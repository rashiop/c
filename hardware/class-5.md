## Digital vs Analog
 
 digital - 0 | 1 (2 is the voltage on or off)
 - switch on or off

 analog - can be vary by time (range min max)
 - +5 ve - on
 - +4.5ve - on 
 - e.g: reduce increase brightness volume

  that mean our phone is combination of digital and analog value, turn off and on use digital, and change the brightness and sound use analog

 input -> received by controller
 output -> sent by controller

 controller
 logic inside device process input to output 

 micro controller (mobile) -- single chip - cant work with complex task, input output memory are integrated in single chip, low speed, low range of memory
 micro processor (pc) -- externally (input out memory unit) -- consume higher power , high speed, high range of memory

 embedded = sw + hw
 how many pins 

 arduino
 adv: open source, efficient & cheap & easy to use sensor & lots of library

 gpio
 general purpose I/O

 tx = transmiter
 power jack insert power colok
 power source
 battery
